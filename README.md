# A Curated Collection of Resources for Practicing Software Engineering Fundamentals using Leetcode Style Problems in C++

Hello there,

I am [Azmyin Md. Kamal](https://mechazo11.github.io/), a robotics reseacher and graduate student from Louisiana State University. 

In 2025, I went through several Robotics and Software Engineering interviews for summer internships. As a Mechanical Engineer (non-CS), I struggled to find structured resources that quickly teach data structures and algorithms in C++ for solving popular LeetCode problems. Most well-documented and beginner-friendly solutions were in Python, making the learning curve even steeper.

Hence, I started this repository to help others, especially those from non-CS backgrounds to practice data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving in C++. My goal is to make this a collaborative knowledge base for aspiring Robotics Software Engineers and Software Engineers.

All codes are MIT licensed. For the best experience, I recommend using VSCode, which works on both Windows and Linux.


## TL;DR

**TODO** a very quick summary of how to approach software engineering interviews

**TODO** how to cite AI-generated code, 

## DISCLAIMER NOTE
